# Markerceratops
#### [AR.js](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/) marker location testing research
This research project was developed during the AEC Tech 2021 - UK hackathon.  It aimed to suss out where the free, browser-based AR state of the art is these days. 


## Dino Demo - [https://bhowes-tt.github.io/Markerceratops/](https://bhowes-tt.github.io/Markerceratops/)
Starting with AR.js studio and a .glb file of a Triceratops skull exported from Tinkercad, prove that AR.js can handle GLTFs and custom marker patterns.

## Mirar Blob Demo - [https://bhowes-tt.github.io/Markerceratops/blob/](https://bhowes-tt.github.io/Markerceratops/blob/)
Similar to the Dino demo, but using a model that came from Grasshopper.  Stepping closer to AEC content.
